                features, content, or application services offered from time to time by PixelOpen in
                connection therewith (collectively, the 'Website' or 'Service'), or using any of our services, you

            <p>
                We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our
                Service. While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable
                information that can be used to contact or identify you. Additionally, we may collect other data that,
                while not itself personally identifiable, is associated in our systems with personally identifiable
                data. The listing below outlines the data that we collect, why we collect it, our legal basis under the
                General Data Protection Regulation for doing so, and our retention policies for each type of data.

                            Policy. Your IP address is used for credit card and account fraud prevention, and customer
                            support. The date and time you signed up is used for customer support.

                            We offer image processing services. In the course of using these services, you upload images
                            to us, which we store and process on your behalf. In addition to storing the image itself,
                            we also record a variety of associated information, such as meta-data, configuration
                            settings, and image processing output.

                            These image processing records are the main deliverable that you get from using our service.
                            We retain them on your behalf so that you can view and download them as you wish, and to
                            provide customer support. From time to time, we may also use them to improve the image
                            processing algorithms that underlie the services we offer.

                                    on PixelOpen.COM. When you subscribe, we record relevant subscription details such

                            Purchases are central to how we earn money and how you gain access to the services we offer.
                            Purchase records are essential for financial accounting, legal compliance, strategic
                            planning, and general operations. IP addresses and timestamps are used for fraud prevention
                            and customer support.

                                    that is initiated through the customer support form is sent by our web servers to
                                    our email servers as an email. In addition to the information provided directly by
                                    the user in the form, we also collect information about the operating system and web
                                    browser they are using (collectively referred to as the 'user agent').

                            period that the law requires us to retain transaction records.

            <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
            <p>
                Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located
                outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection
                laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your
                agreement to that transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                PixelOpen will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
                securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Disclosure of Data</h2>
            <h3>Disclosure to Law Enforcement</h3>
            <p>
                Under certain circumstances, PixelOpen may be required to disclose your personal data if
                required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a
                government agency).
            </p>
            <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                PixelOpen may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief that such action is
                necessary:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
                <li>
                    To protect and defend the rights or property of PixelOpen
                </li>
                <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
                <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
                <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                The security of your data is important to us and we use industry standard technical and organizational
                measures to protect your information. For example, our Website is served over HTTPS and we implement
                data security organizational access controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is completely and
                entirely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your data,
                we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                                website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our
                                Service. This data may be shared with other Google services. Google may use the
                                collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
